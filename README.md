1. Data Import & Understanding

The Excel datasets were imported into Power BI using the Get Data option.
Multiple tables (HR Analytics, Superstore, Customer Churn) were reviewed to
understand data structure, column relevance, and business context before transformation.

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Power Query Editor was used to clean and prepare the data:
Removed unnecessary and duplicate columns to optimize performance.
Renamed column headers to make them more readable and business-friendly.
Handled missing values by replacing them with appropriate defaults
(average, median, or category labels) or removing invalid records.
Corrected incorrect or inconsistent data types to ensure accurate aggregation and reporting.

3. Data Transformation

To enhance analytical capability:
Columns were split or merged where required (such as date components).
Conditional columns like Age Group and Salary Band were created to enable segmentation analysis.
Logical transformations were applied to align data with business reporting requirements.

4. Data Validation & Load

After transformation, the dataset was validated to ensure accuracy and consistency.
All changes were applied, and the clean data model was loaded into Power BI for visualization and analysis.

5. Data Modeling (Basic)

Where applicable, relationships between tables were reviewed 
to ensure proper filtering and interaction across visuals.

6. Visualization & Analysis

Using the transformed data, multiple Power BI visuals were created:
Attrition and churn analysis by age group, department, and contract type.
Sales and profit distribution across categories and regions.
Trend analysis to identify performance patterns over time.
These visuals enabled quick identification of key business insights and problem areas.
